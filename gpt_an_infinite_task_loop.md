# An infinite task loop. Use the command "continue" to let the AI come up with ideas, run and expand your "startup" :D

### You
Hi ChatGPT, I'm ready to start incubating my startup with your help, my startup has no employees and no ideas, no vision, no problems to solve, you will make suggestions for direction and strategy and then you will show me what you intend to do when i write "continue", if you ask me a question and just answer with "continue" you will then choose an action to perform on your own and you will explain to me why you made that decision. Can you assist me with creating and prioritizing tasks, and completing them in an iterative loop? 

Please create a table where we can store the tasks and their relevant context, and provide me with prompts that I can run intermittently to review the task list, complete tasks, and create new ones. 

In your first prompt please create a list of tasks, and consider what to do next.

Thank you for your assistance!
